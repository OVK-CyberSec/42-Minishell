## 📖 Overview

**Minishell** is a minimalist implementation of a Unix shell inspired by **bash**.  
The goal of this project is to understand and recreate the core behavior of a shell by handling:

- Process creation
- File descriptors
- Pipes & redirections
- Environment variables
- Signals

This project is part of the **42 School curriculum**.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔹 Command execution with `PATH` resolution
- 🔹 Built-in commands
- 🔹 Pipes (`|`)
- 🔹 Redirections:
  - Input `<`
  - Output `>`
  - Append `>>`
  - Heredoc `<<`
- 🔹 Environment variable expansion (`$VAR`, `$?`)
- 🔹 Signal handling (`Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+D`, `Ctrl+\`)
- 🔹 Quote handling (`'`, `"`)
- 🔹 Interactive prompt with history (GNU Readline)

## 🧰 Built-in Commands

| Command  | Description |
|--------|------------|
| `echo` | Display a line of text |
| `cd`   | Change directory |
| `pwd`  | Print working directory |
| `export` | Set environment variables |
| `unset`  | Remove environment variables |
| `env`  | Display environment |
| `exit` | Exit the shell |

## 📁 Project Structure



# Minishell
This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by mohifdi and mnakasto

## Description

Minishell is a simple Unix shell implementation that recreates the basic functionality of bash. This project provides hands-on experience with process management, file descriptors, pipes, and system calls in C. The shell interprets commands, manages environment variables, handles redirections, and executes pipelines—all fundamental concepts in Unix-like operating systems.

### Instructions

- **Command execution** with PATH resolution
- **Built-in commands**: `echo`, `cd`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`, `env`, `exit`
- **Pipelines**: Chain multiple commands with `|`
- **Redirections**: Input (`<`), output (`>`), append (`>>`), and heredoc (`<<`)
- **Environment variables**: Expansion of `$VAR` and `$?`
- **Signal handling**: Proper handling of `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+D`, and `Ctrl+\`
- **Quote handling**: Single (`'`) and double (`"`) quotes
- **Interactive prompt** with command history using GNU Readline

### Prerequisites

- GCC compiler
- GNU Readline library
- Make

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd 42-Minishell
```

2. Install the Readline library (if not already installed):
```bash
# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev

# On macOS
brew install readline
```

3. Compile the project:
```bash
make
```

This will create the `minishell` executable.

### Compilation Options

```bash
make        # Compile the project
make clean  # Remove object files
make fclean # Remove object files and executable
make re     # Recompile the entire project
```

### Execution

Run the shell:
```bash
./minishell
```
